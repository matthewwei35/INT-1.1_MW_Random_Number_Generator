### How to Use
Goto the Github Pages I currently have random number generator [here](https://matthewwei35.github.io/).

### Project Motivation
I wanted to build a random number generator because I utilize them when I do not know what to choose in a given selection. The reasoning is because I am indecisive. My goal is to use the skills I learned in my Term 1 class and to create something that I can show to my peers.
