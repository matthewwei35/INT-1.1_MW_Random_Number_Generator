# Intensive 1.1 - Random Number Generator

## Description
A random number generator website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

#### Project Motivation
I wanted to build a random number generator because I utilize them when I do not know what to choose in a given selection, especially because I am indecisive. My goal is to use the skills I learned in my Term 1 class and to create something that I can show to my peers.
